# q-learning-football-agent-tfg
This project implements classical Q-Learning agents to play a simplified 1vs1 football game in a custom environment. The agents learn to move and interact with the ball to score goals using discrete actions and states.

## About the Project

The goal is to explore reinforcement learning techniques applied to agent in football scenarios. The project focuses on:

- Implementing classical Q-Learning (no deep networks) due to manageable state spaces  
- Designing reward functions that encourage goal scoring and ball control  
- Training and evaluating agents in a 2D football environment  

The final results demonstrate the agentâ€™s capability to learn basic football tactics, though there is room for improvement in strategy complexity and environment realism.
